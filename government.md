# Open Source by government

Somewhat surprisingly there are many local and country-wise governments around the world that share some of their software under and Open Source license. We are collecting them in this list.

There are separate lists for [Open Source by Higher Education](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-higher-education) and [Open Source by Corporations](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-corporations)
